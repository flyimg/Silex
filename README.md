# Flyimg Silex Adaptation

This repository hosts a customized fork of the [Silex micro-framework](https://silex.symfony.com/), adapted specifically for Flyimg's image processing and service needs. 
This version replaces outdated Silex components with the latest Symfony components to ensure compatibility, security, and future-proof functionality.

## Overview

Silex was a popular micro-framework for PHP projects, particularly suited for lightweight applications and services. However, as Silex is now deprecated, this repository provides a maintained, Flyimg-specific adaptation that retains the simplicity of Silex while integrating the latest Symfony components.

## Key Adaptations

1. **Symfony Component Upgrades**: Replaced outdated Silex components with their latest Symfony equivalents for performance and security improvements.
2. **Flyimg Customizations**: Optimized for Flyimg’s image processing requirements, including community-driven features and performance tweaks.
3. **Dependency Modernization**: Updated package dependencies to align with current PHP best practices and Flyimg’s specific use cases.

## Getting Started

To get started with this adapted Silex fork, clone this repository and install dependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Flyimg/Silex.git
cd Silex
composer install
```

## Requirements

- PHP >= 7.4 (or as required by your project)
- Composer for dependency management

## Basic Usage

This adapted version remains compatible with the original Silex service setup, so most Silex-based applications can run with minimal code changes.

Define services and route controllers in your application using the familiar Silex structure.
Register any required Symfony services in app.php to take advantage of the latest features and integrations.
For example:

```php
$app = new Silex\Application();

$app->register(new Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Service\UrlGeneratorServiceProvider());
$app->get('/', function () {
    return "Welcome to the Flyimg Silex adaptation!";
});

$app->run();
```

## Configuration and Customization

Configuration settings can be adjusted in the config/ directory to suit your environment and Flyimg’s particular needs.
